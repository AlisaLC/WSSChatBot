Different levels of inference about pairwise regional interactions: testing for shared information in brain and in models
زبان ارائه: فارسی
کلیدواژه‌ها: Neuroscience, ML, Neural networks, Information Theory
خلاصه ارائه:
Classic approaches to functional connectivity of two brain regions consider the correlation between regional average time courses. This type of analysis makes it possible to infer whether two regions are co-active or not. Another level of inference is to test whether two regions have shared information. For that, multi-dimensional connectivity methods are suited. Those methods do not require averaging, that can lose information, and target the information content of high-dimensional activity patterns. In my presentation I will talk about a class of multi-dimensional connectivity methods, named representational connectivity analysis. I will talk about different variants of RCA (model-free and model-based RCA) and the different types of inferences they support. Finally, I will talk about a geometric-aware extension of model-free RCA, distance between 2nd moment matrices on the Riemannian manifold, which makes it possible to test for co-activation and shared information simultaneously.

خلاصه ارائه:
Computing is bottlenecked by data. Large amounts of application data overwhelm the storage capability, communication capability, and computation capability of the modern machines we design today. As a result, many key applications' performance, efficiency, and scalability are bottlenecked by data movement. In this talk, we describe three major shortcomings of modern architectures in terms of 1) dealing with data, 2) taking advantage of vast amounts of data, and 3) exploiting different semantic properties of application data. We argue that an intelligent architecture should be designed to handle data well. We show that handling data well requires designing architectures based on three key principles: 1) data-centric, 2) data-driven, and 3) data-aware. We give several examples of how to exploit each of these principles to design a much more efficient and high-performance computing system. We especially discuss recent research that aims to fundamentally reduce memory latency and energy and practically enable computation close to data with storage-centric computing.

کلیدواژه‌ها: Video understanding, Activity segmentation, Procedural tasks, Sequence alignment, Attention, Human-object-interaction
خلاصه ارائه:
Humans perform a wide range of complex activities, such as cooking hour-long recipes, assembling and repairing devices and performing surgeries. Many of these activities are procedural: they consist of sequences of steps that must be followed to achieve the desired goals. Learning complex procedural activities from videos allows us to design intelligent task assistants, robots  and coaching platforms that either perform or guide users through different tasks. However, learning from complex activity videos has many challenges: the videos are long, uncurated and contain many task-irrelevant activities, different videos show different ways of performing the same task or step, gathering framewise annotation is not scalable to many videos and tasks, and steps are often fine-grained. In this talk, I will discuss methods for efficient and robust learning from complex activity videos that address these challenges.

عنوان ارائه: Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection
زبان ارائه: فارسی
کلیدواژه‌ها: Out-of-Distribution Detection; Anomaly Detection; Adversarial Robustness; Adversarial Training
خلاصه ارائه:
In recent years, there have been significant improvements in various forms of image outlier detection. However, outlier detection performance under adversarial settings lags far behind that in standard settings. This is due to the lack of effective exposure to adversarial scenarios during training, especially on unseen outliers, leading to detection models failing to learn robust features. To bridge this gap, we introduce RODEO, a data-centric approach that generates effective outliers for robust outlier detection. More specifically, we show that incorporating outlier exposure (OE) and adversarial training could be an effective strategy for this purpose, as long as the exposed training outliers meet certain characteristics, including diversity, and both conceptual differentiability and analogy to the inlier samples. We leverage a text-to-image model to achieve this goal. We demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that our adaptive OE method effectively generates ``diverse'' and ``near-distribution'' outliers, leveraging information from both text and image domains.

زبان ارائه: فارسی
کلیدواژه‌ها: Cognitive Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, Neural Engineering, Cognitive Health
خلاصه ارائه:
Private, subjective beliefs about uncertainty have been found to have idiosyncratic
computational and neural substrates yet, humans share such beliefs seamlessly and cooperate successfully. Bringing together decision making under uncertainty and interpersonal alignment in communication, in a discovery plus pre-registered replication design, we examined the neurocomputational basis of the relationship between privately held and socially shared uncertainty. Examining the confidence-speed-accuracy trade-off in uncertainty-ridden perceptual decisions under social vs isolated context, we found that shared (i.e. reported confidence) and subjective (inferred from pupillometry) uncertainty dynamically followed social information. An attractor neural network model incorporating social information as top-down additive input captured the observed behavior and demonstrated the emergence of social alignment in virtual dyadic simulations.

زبان ارائه: فارسی

Mean-field, Generalization error
خلاصه ارائه:
We propose a novel framework for exploring weak generalization error of algorithms through the lens of differential calculus on the space of probability measures. Specifically, we consider the KL-regularized empirical risk minimization problem and establish generic conditions under which the generalization error convergence rate, when training on a sample of size n, is O(1/n). In the context of supervised learning with a one-hidden layer neural network in the mean-field regime, these conditions are reflected in suitable integrability and regularity assumptions on the loss and activation functions.

خلاصه ارائه:
Although the fabless model frees the semiconductor industry from having to invest in pricey manufacturing facilities and equipment, it poses additional security challenges, such as malicious insertion of hardware Trojans and hardware Intellectual Property (IP) theft; it also increases the need for designing secure hardware security primitives such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for device authentication and key generation. The situation has worsened as integrating third-party IP cores and utilizing different Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools has become the norm. Given the current trend, we have no choice but to consider a zero-trust environment in the IC design flow. The focus of this seminar is on machine learning solutions for three critical hardware security areas, including secure execution, intellectual property protection, and hardware security primitives in a zero-trust environment.

کلیدواژه‌ها: Biometrics, Face Recognition, Face Reconstruction, Template Inversion (TI) attack, Security, Privacy
خلاصه ارائه:
Face recognition systems are increasingly being used in different applications. In such systems, some features (also known as embeddings or templates) are extracted from each face image. Then, the extracted templates are stored in the system’s database during the enrollment stage and are later used for recognition. In this talk, I explain template inversion attacks against face recognition systems, where an adversary gains access to the templates stored in the database of the system and tries to reconstruct underlying faces from facial templates. The reconstructed face images not only reveal privacy-sensitive information (such as age, gender, etc.), but can also be used to impersonate. As a matter of fact, the reconstructed face images jeopardize both security and privacy of users: the adversary can use the reconstructed face image to impersonate and enter the system (security threat). In addition, the reconstructed face image not only reveals privacy-sensitive information of the enrolled user, such as age, gender, ethnicity, etc, but also provides a good estimation of the subject's face (privacy threat).

کلیدواژه‌ها: ML Systems, Multi-Objective Optimization, ML Inference Pipeline, System Performance
خلاصه ارائه:
ML inference services engage with users directly, requiring fast and accurate responses. Moreover, these services face dynamic workloads of requests, imposing changes in their computing resources, and failing to right-size computing resources results in either latency service level objectives (SLOs) violations or wasted computing resources. Adapting to dynamic workloads considering all the pillars of accuracy, latency, and resource cost is challenging. In this talk, I will present our recent solutions to the above-mentioned challenges: InfAdapter [1] and IPA [2]. InfAdapter combines model-switching and auto-scaling to trade accuracy, cost, and latency in inference serving systems, while IPA dynamically re-configures ML inference pipelines to achieve the tradeoff. 
InfAdapter: InfAdapter proactively selects a set of ML model variants with their resource allocations to meet latency SLO while maximizing an objective function of accuracy and cost.

Platforms have become an important way to organize work. However, many researchers and unions have pointed out the limitations of platforms, such as Uber and Mechanical Turk, for workers. In this talk, we begin by presenting problems with dominant ride hail platforms (e.g. Uber and Lyft) for workers. We then explain the barriers to innovation faced by workers developing a platform that serves their needs. This work draws on our recent publication "Hostile Ecologies: Navigating the Barriers to Community-Led Innovation'' from ACM CSCW 2022. We then show how our UCSD research team worked with United Taxi Workers San Diego to overcome these barriers through design, data policy analysis, and software engineering assistance. The result is our labor union ride hail platform RideUnited. We conclude with lessons on how human-computer interaction shifts when workers and worker organizations are placed at the center of systems development.

خلاصه ارائه:
Forecasting is a capability inherent in humans when navigating. Humans routinely plan their paths, considering the potential future movements of those around them. Similarly, to achieve comparable sophistication and safety, autonomous systems must embrace this predictive nature. Deep generative models have played a pivotal role in advancing these systems in recent years. The presentation begins with the introduction of generative models in trajectory forecasting. A novel automated assessment, described as an essential but previously unexplored approach, is presented to objectively evaluate the performance of these models, shedding light on how state-of-the-art models can generate forecasts that violate social norms and scene constraints. To mitigate that, the impact of additional visual cues that humans subconsciously exhibit when navigating space is explored. Moving on to a fine-grained representation, human body pose forecasting is discussed. A generic model is introduced to deal with not only clean environments but also real-world noisy observations.

عنوان ارائه: Evaluation of Generative Models in Federated Learning
زبان ارائه: فارسی
کلیدواژه‌ها: Generative models, federated learning, evaluation in machine learning
خلاصه ارائه:
The evaluation of deep generative models has been extensively studied in the machine learning community. While the existing evaluation methods focus on centralized learning problems with training data stored by a single client, many applications of generative models concern distributed learning settings, e.g. in federated learning, where training data are collected by and distributed among several clients. In this seminar, we discuss the evaluation of generative models in distributed contexts. We show potential inconsistent rankings following different aggregations of standard evaluation scores, such as FID distance, in a distributed network. We present numerical results on benchmark datasets and generative model training schemes to support our theoretical findings on the evaluation of generative models in distributed learning settings.

خلاصه ارائه:
Roughly a decade ago, inspired by the phenomenal success of cloud computing, a group of researchers have defined Vehicular Clouds as a group of vehicles whose sensing, communication, and computing resources can be coordinated and allocated to authorized users. While both conventional and Vehicular Clouds are instances of utility computing, a number of important characteristics set vehicular clouds apart from their conventional counterparts. These characteristics include the mobility of vehicles and the volatility of resources that fluctuate with the arrival and departure of vehicles. 
Our main contribution is to enhance the dependability of VC through a family of redundancy-based job assignment strategies that mitigates the effect of resource volatility in VCs

زبان ارائه: فارسی
کلیدواژه‌ها: Wireless Sensing, Internet of Things, Cyber physical systems, Wireless Networks
خلاصه ارائه:
Emerging applications such as smart cities, autonomous vehicles, or smart metaverse, all rely on embedded systems that are engaging with the physical environment through sensors. That means a home that monitors your activities and health status, learns your habits and preferences, and automatically controls lighting, air conditioning, and more. One of the pillars of success for these emerging applications is an efficient and robust mechanism for sensing the physical world. Recent advances in wireless technologies present new promising possibilities to harness the wireless infrastructure in and around buildings and cities to act as a non-intrusive sensing platform. In effect, this network of wireless devices creates an ocean of radio waves that interact with each other and the environment in complex ways. This talk will focus on how to convert any commodity wireless device into an individual sensor by mapping their wireless reflections to relevant physical and behavioral measurements in the context of human sensing, object tracking, and indoor localization.

عنوان ارائه: Lost in Translation: A Study of Bugs Introduced by Large Language Models while Translating Code
زبان ارائه: فارسی
کلیدواژه‌ها: LLM4Code, Code translation and transpilation
خلاصه ارائه:
Code translation aims to convert source code from one programming language (PL) to another. Given the promising abilities of large language models (LLMs) in code synthesis, researchers are exploring their potential to automate code translation. The prerequisite for advancing the state of LLM-based code translation is to understand their promises and limitations over existing techniques. To that end, we present a large-scale empirical study to investigate the ability of general LLMs and code LLMs for code translation across pairs of different languages, including C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our study, which involves the translation of 1,700 code samples from three benchmarks and two real-world projects, reveals that LLMs are yet to be reliably used to automate code translation—with correct translations ranging from 2.1% to 47.3% for the studied LLMs. Further manual investigation of unsuccessful translations identifies 15 categories of translation bugs. We also compare LLM-based code translation with traditional non-LLM-based approaches.
